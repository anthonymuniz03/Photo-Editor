# Photo-Editor
 
 - Writers note: Will be listing features and keeping them outlined
 
I want to make a photo editing app. One where, you can display your work on the home screen or access a library of your edited images. At the bare minimum, I want the user to be able to draw, crop, and add text to their images. Of course the images they edit would come from their phones photo library, which means I would need access to their photos. I like the idea of this as I could incorporate some form of memorabilia section where a person can place their favorite images into a folder and I could have preset texts as well.

The home screen, or the first view, would have a button that then opens your phones gallery and has you pick one.
- or include an option to take a picture and use the just taken picture 

 From there you are taken to a view where you can select from some options of what you would like to do: 
- add text
- crop the image
- change color saturation
- combine images
- save to folder & create folder
- etc. 

The home screen would also have a form of navigation button that opens a smaller view. This is where you can locate:
- The settings
- Access the gallery
- Access the memorabilia gallery
- Access your hidden images
- Access your trashed/deleted images

From what I've gathered, most of this can be done without the use of an API or firebase. The folders and saving images could be done with the appâ€™s local storage.
For this capstone project I plan to mostly focus on basic image editing like I have listed, but if possible would like to experiment and try some harder editing options.

I've added a rough mock up of the general layout of the app, styling and options are set to change!
